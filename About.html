        <p>Hi there! My name is Ena, I'm from Osijek, Croatia. I'm a self-taught artist and my work is based on abstract forms of expressionism. <br>
           I like to give my paintings life and depth with lots of bright and screaming colors.<br>
            <br>
            I am mostly based on canvas artwork with acrylic or watercolor paint, but sometimes I enjoy doing pencil art on paper as well.<br>
            I hope you'll find something that interests you on my art portfolio.<br>
           <br>  
            The basis of my work is on my instagram account: <a href="https://instagram.com/abstractbutterfly_?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=" target="_blank">@abstract_butterfly </a><br>
            There you can find videos of the whole process of drawing each of my works. <br>
            If you want to order a painting, give me a call or send me a message by clicking on the "Contact Me" button below, or send me a message on instagram. :)<br>
